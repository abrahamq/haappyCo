      <p>HaappyCo Corporations was founded with the purpose to combat the terrors of
      the Oil Wars. At the time, a majority of the world’s oil supplies had dried up
      and the miniscule amount left was sold to the highest bidder leaving millions
      around the world without power and transportation. The world’s energy demand had
      finally surpassed the world’s supply of energy and the worst energy crisis in
      history was in effect. It was at this time that our three founders, Samuel Lee,
      Janice Winslow, and Pete Simms, dedicated to solving the energy crisis and
      ending the Oil Wars, came up with a method to utilize 89% of the sun’s energy
      with solar panels. The most efficient solar panels of the era. Through funding
      from countries all around the world, HaappyCo was created with the purpose to
      provide every human being access to energy. In just a short five years, solar
      panels were available and every country and the Oil Wars had completely ended.
